# School_District_Analysis
Analyzing standardized testing data using Pandas and Jupyter 
## Overview of Project

### Purpose

In this analysis, we were tasked with finding metrics for a school district's performance based on a number of factors. We were able to sort our data by grade, school, and spending through the use of the pandas dependency for python. We were able to break down the data further to look at one school, Thomas High School, that was having trouble with suspected cheating and were able to remove the potential bad data that could have skewed the analysis.

### What the data shows us.
